It was added variables "admin" and "name". Filled name as John and attached to admin. After that showed by alert function.
It was added variable "ourPlanet" for the name of our planet (not Earth because maybe someone from the other planet :))
It was added variable "currentUserName" for the user's name who is currently on the website.
Type of variable "num" is string as when adding a number and a string, JavaScript will treat the number as a string.
